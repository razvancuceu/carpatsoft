<p>2015 was the year of a lot of changes and innovations, but 2016 has a lot more in store. More and more people are accessing the Internet via mobile devices than desktop computers. </p>
<p>If you are a web designer, or you have a website you should follow these trends in 2016: </p>
<br><br>
<h2>1. User centered design</h2>
<p>Researches shown that the average user spends 10-20 seconds on a webpage before leaving, and the way to improve this is by having the point straight and a clear value proposition.  One of the highlights of <i>Google’s Quality Guidelines</i> is that having content front centered is a big deal. Content placed above the fold is better ranked than the content placed below ads and other elements.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>2. Single page design</h2>
<p>People no longer want to go through a lot of pages, and many websites are focusing into this by having a single-page design.</p>

<h2>3. More of Material Design</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a> own by Google was announced in 2014 and is a design language that uses shadow effects, responsive animations and grid based layouts for creating realistic design with focus on UX.</p>
<p>Because minimalistic designs are in trend, you can expect more of Material Design for creating a fast and realistic look.
<br><br>
<h2>4.SVG</h2>
<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) became more popular in 2015; Google redesigned its logo to a cleaner, smaller SVG file. SVG is becoming popular because it’s graphic is presented as vector that can be scaled at any size without worrying about the resolution.</p>
<p>Almost every browser supports SVG, so you can expect to see SVG going mainstream in 2016</p>
<br><br>
<h2>5. Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>From a few years ago responsive web design has been a trend, and will be even in 2016.</p> 
<p>For a long time, website owners have known the importance and the power of the responsive web design but they haven’t taken it as seriously until “Google Mobilegeddon” in 2015. Google wanted to ensure that websites adapt to all mobile devices and started to penalize websites that weren’t mobile-friendly.</p>
