VRCreed is a platform created exclusively for virtual reality content as well as 360 degree videos. The creators are two guys who understood the importance of VR in the next stage of internet, gaming and video development. We have started to work at VRCreed.com in February 2016 and by March a Beta Version of the website was released. Since then we have been working constantly to improve the VR Platform and we are really proud about what we obtained.


VRCreed is a new marketplace where VR content producers (being them games, videos or educational content) can upload their work, in a simple manner and with little effort. Each producer will have after registration a vendor account, and they can manage their products in terms of pricing, sales, metrics.

On the other hand, <a href="www.vrcreed.com" name="VRCreed VR Games and VR Apps">www.vrcreed.com</a> is the place where any VR user can come and easily download any content they would like for their specific VR set. We are talking about Cardboard, Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung etc. The virtual reality content suitable for our platform consist in movies, games, videos, sports, educational and medical, which can be operated on Windows, Mac, Android or IOS.

The Uploading Process is extremely simple, consisting in 4 steps. But first, the produce has to register as a vendor on the VRCreed platform. For the moment, the mobile version doesnâ€™t support uploading, but in the future will certainly be integrated.

The world of VR needs a new place where the VR content can be revealed. Any headset user should have the possibility of downloading quickly and in a really easy manner the VR games or Experiences they are looking for.

VRCreed will be improved constantly and will be optimized for offering the best user experience.

At the end of the day, everyone should agree that the VR industry is yet an emerging market and can see in it a huge potential in the following years.
